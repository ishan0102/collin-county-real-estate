## Data
Each owner information record is stored as an 847 character string. This string can be sliced for each piece of information and stored in a data frame. The raw data files won't be uploaded to protect privacy.

## Usage
Run the `parse_condensed` script to generate the raw CSV files from the text files. You can edit the variables to scrape from the raw text files here.

Run `main.py` to generate filtered CSV files of delinquent property taxes and their corresponding owners. You can edit the filters here.
